# LazyVim Configuration

Welcome to my LazyVim configuration repository! LazyVim is a minimalist Neovim setup focused on simplicity and efficiency. Here, you'll find my personalized configuration optimized for productivity with minimal fuss.

## Features

- **Lightweight:** Designed with simplicity in mind, keeping the configuration minimal yet effective.
- **Efficiency:** Streamlined keybindings and plugins to enhance productivity without overwhelming complexity.
- **Clean Interface:** A clutter-free interface for distraction-free coding sessions.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Uses a minimal set of plugins and dependencies to keep things lightweight and fast.
- **Easy Customization:** Customize and extend the configuration easily to suit your workflow and preferences.

## Installation

1. **Clone Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dvarshanidze/lazyvim.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```

 ```Start Neovim for changes to take effect.```

## Usage

Explore the configuration files (`init.vim` and other `.vim` files) to understand the setup and make any adjustments according to your preferences. LazyVim aims to provide a clean and efficient environment out of the box, but you're encouraged to tweak it to your liking.
